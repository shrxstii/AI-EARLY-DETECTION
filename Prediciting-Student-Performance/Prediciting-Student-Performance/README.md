# 🎓 AI-Based Student Performance Prediction & Early Academic Intervention System

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a full-stack AI-powered academic analytics system designed to predict student performance early in the semester and identify at-risk students before academic failure occurs.

The platform integrates Machine Learning, interactive visualization, explainable AI techniques, and role-based authentication to provide educators with actionable insights for proactive intervention.

This system transforms traditional reactive academic monitoring into a predictive and decision-support framework.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Conventional academic evaluation systems identify struggling students only after significant academic decline.

This project introduces:

- Early grade prediction using ML
- Automated risk classification
- Explainable AI insights
- Fairness & bias analysis
- Interactive educator dashboard

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline

### 🔹 Models Used

- **Random Forest Regressor** → Final Grade Prediction  
- **Random Forest Classifier** → Risk Category Prediction  

---

### 🔹 Input Features

- G1 (First Internal Grade)  
- G2 (Second Internal Grade)  
- Study Time  
- Past Failures  
- Absences  

---

### 🔹 Target Variable

- G3 (Final Grade)

## 📊 Risk Classification Logic

Based on predicted grade (0–20 scale):

- **High Risk** → Grade < 10  
- **Medium Risk** → 10 – 14  
- **Low Risk** → ≥ 15
